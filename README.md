## POC to automate the process of generating a report of BIG-IP hardware license usage for an F5 HELA

> ansible-playbook playbooks/helaSWonHW.yml --vault-password-file vault/vaultPass.yml

- This playbook will generate a CSV file that contains various information needed to track software used on BIG-IP
    - see documents/2021-09-23_hela_SWonHW_example.csv for example of what is generated by playbook
- BIG-IP devices are located listOfDevices/bigipListOfDevices.yml; this list can be updated for your network or the playbook could be modified to pull the list from an external repo
- Update password and username in ansible-vault; vault/vault.yml.  The password for the vault is 'admin'.
    - **Create your own vault or update the password for included vault**
